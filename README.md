ðŸ‘‹Hi there!:relaxed: I'm a Data Scientist, and I'm using Python to analyze data and make several ML models.

I like various experiences because I am curious.:musical_note:
I like to acquire new knowledge quickly and apply what I learned to work right away:thumbsup:

I'm trying to live a challenging life without regrets.
I will be a Data Scientist who can bring good results!!:fire:
